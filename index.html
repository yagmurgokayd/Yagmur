<p><h3><i>&#128570ITEMS TO BUY BEFORE ADOPTING A CAT&#128570</i></h3></p>
<p><h5>Hi, I'd like to start a series of basic information for people who have never taken care of a cat before.</p></h5>
<p><h5>The first topic is the things to buy before adopting a cat.</h5></p>
<p><h5>I can see now that I made so many mistakes in the beginning that I spent a lot of money on useless, crappy things.</h5></p>
<p><h5>I want to approach the subject from this perspective. Buying a few simple items will be enough in the beginning,</h5></p> 
<p><h5>but you need to choose them correctly so that you don't spend money on the same thing over and over again.</h5></p>
<p><h5>Let's start if you are ready.</h5></p>

<h2> <p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">1- CAT CARRIER BAG </p></h2>
First of all, I want to show you two cat carrier bags that you will probably buy but I would NEVER recommend you to buy;
<p><h2>Classic Simple Plastic Cat Carrier Bags</h2> </p> 
<center><img class="resim" src="https://productimages.hepsiburada.net/s/18/375-375/9796588863538.jpg" width="200" height="200"></center>
I never recommend these classic plastic cat carrier bags that are available in pet stores under many different brand names. Why?
<p>1- Very poor quality plastics</p> 
<p>2-Joints often do not fit perfectly</p> 
<p>3- The locks on the door are VERY dysfunctional, they can EASILY be opened by pushing the cat.</p> 
Most of us bought these cat carrier bags when we first adopted a cat. If our cat was a kitten, it worked for a few months and then it was trashed. Many cat owners chased cats on the streets because of the easy opening of the door. Therefore, I do not recommend it. It will not work for you after a while.   
Transparent Plastic Cat Carrier Backpacks
</p>
<p><h2>Transparent Plastic Cat Carrier Backpacks</h2> </p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://cdn.dsmcdn.com/ty1435/product/media/images/prod/QC/20240604/21/a98669a6-bfba-31b3-9337-8fbf4c1e28ec/1_org_zoom.jpg"width="200" height="200"</center>
<p>The previous example is usually the choice of those who go to any pet store and buy a cat carrier bag. This one is usually the choice of those who buy cat carrier bags by ordering online. This is one of the best-selling cat carrier bags, but again, I NEVER recommend buying one. 
<p>Why?</p>
<p> 1- Ventilation is not enough for cats to breathe easily.</p>
<p>2- Transparent parts have a greenhouse effect especially in summer and travel for cats.</p> 
It's already stressful. It's not possible for them to feel “hidden” in a transparent open bag and it increases the stress level. You can't cover it either, it doesn't have enough ventilation.
<p>3- The dimensions are not enough for an adult cat to sleep comfortably.</p> 
You can use this bag maybe 1-2 times when your cat is small, but it is not healthy and sufficient for later use.
I would not want you to make a mistake by buying these two types of bags when buying a cat carrier bag. For this reason, I wanted to talk about the wrong bags you will probably turn to first. While looking for images of these two bags, I came across this photo;</p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://cdn.dsmcdn.com/ty1500/product/media/images/prod/QC/20240825/00/0f170d50-7de6-3a94-8acc-7cfc0613e6d5/1_org_zoom.jpg" width="200" height="200"  ></center>
<p>I am very, very surprised that it topped the bestseller list. It is NEVER suitable for a cat. A cat will never want to be in this position “like a baby”. It will try to escape and 99% of the time it will get rid of this bag and run away.
I don't even want to think about the stress and fear even if it doesn't escape. Don't make these mistakes. Don't be fooled by the best sellers.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the cat carrier bags I would recommend. I will present two options that I am very satisfied with, you decide.</p>
<p><h2>Ferplast Atlas 10 Cat Bag</h2></p>
<center><img src="https://productimages.hepsiburada.net/s/9/424-600/9095090929714.jpg/format:webp" width="250" height="350"></center>
<p>Ferplast Atlas 10 is a cat carrier bag that I have been using for years with many cats. The things that are a problem with other “simple plastic” cat carrier bags do not cause you problems with this bag. The plastic is strong, the joints are strong, the door is metal and much stronger than the others. You can buy it once and use it for years. I am leaving the link of the bag here.</p>


<a href="https://www.hepsiburada.com/ferplast-atlas-10-kucuk-kopek-ve-kedi-48-x-32-5-x-29-cm-p-PTKZ8010690062853?magaza=Evcilbesinleri" target="_blank">
<p>https://www.hepsiburada.com/ferplast-atlas-10-kucuk-kopek-ve-kedi-48-x-32-5-x-29-cm-p-PTKZ8010690062853?magaza=Evcilbesinleri</p>
</a>


<p><h2>Cat Carrying Backpack</h2></p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://productimages.hepsiburada.net/s/128/424-600/110000079139068.jpg/format:webp" width="200" height="200"></center>
<p>If you want a cat carrier bag that is suitable for carrying on the back and not in the hand, I will recommend a cat carrier bag that I have been using for years with satisfaction. Let me tell you how this bag differs from the others; it has very good ventilation, there is no use of transparent plastic and the dimensions are suitable for cats. Also, the bottom is much better than the others and does not collapse. Again, there are some disadvantages. For example, an adult and frightened cat who is dedicated to getting out of the bag may tear the mesh parts. I use this bag for my own cats, we have not encountered such a problem because they do not make such efforts, but I do not use this bag for the cat I catch from the street for neutering.
As a result; if you are adopting a cat for the first time, if you are not going to use public transportation, if you have a car, etc. Ferplast Atlas 10 will be enough for you for life, but if you are going to take the bus etc. if you don't want to have difficulty carrying your cat, you can buy these backpacks. I have both of them. Right now I only use the backpack one for ours.</p>
<p>I'll leave the link to the bag here.</p>

<p><h2> <p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">2- CAT TOILET-CAT LITTER BOX </p></h2> </p>
<p>Everything waits a bit, but not the litter box. You need to provide a cat toilet before you adopt your cat. I mean, after all, where are they going to go to the toilet, right?&#128513 Let's start again with the examples that we all buy unknowingly at first and then become garbage.</p>

<p><h2>Outdoor Cat Toilet</h2></p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://static.ticimax.cloud/cdn-cgi/image/width=-,quality=85/30512/uploads/urunresimleri/buyuk/trixie-acik-kedi-tuvaleti-38-cm-x-11-c-483e-a.jpg" width="200" height="200" </center>
   
<p>The problem with these cat toilets is that they are open. When the cats are digging, sand gets everywhere. It's a pain to clean. Don't buy it, it's unbearable. </p>
 
<p><h2>Indoor Giant Cat Toilet</h2></p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://productimages.hepsiburada.net/s/55/424-600/11228376629298.jpg/format:webp"  width="200" height="200"  </center>
<p>I think I discovered this cat toilet about 2 years ago. I didn't even realize how small the others were until I bought this one. Measurements; 47×66.5×51. It's really huge compared to the others! We can say that it's ideal for an adult cat weighing 6-7 kilos. It also has two lidded compartments. It's good for storing bags and shovels. I think it makes the most sense to buy this litter box from the beginning. If your cat is very small, you can first use it with the lid open. Once you get used to it, you turn it off and you can use it for years without any problems. Ideal <3 
</p>
<p>I'll leave the link to the bag here.</p>

 <a/>
<p><h2><p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">3-CAT LITTER </p></h2> </p>
<p>Now that we have our litter box and shovel, we need to buy the litter to put it in. This choice is also very important. If you don't want your house to smell of cat toilet, dust, sand, smoke, you need to choose the right litter. Because many people can be allergic to cat litter dust, then they think they are allergic to the cat &#128577 so the right choice is important!
 Unfortunately, I can't recommend you a single litter, I can't say buy brand X. I haven't found EXACTLY what I want either, but I can recommend a few brands that won't upset you much in the first choice. For new cat owners, clumping pellets and non-clumping pellet litters will be difficult to use. You may not be able to manage the cat's adaptation process. For this reason, I will only recommend bentonite litters, but I definitely recommend you to research other litters in the future!</p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://productimages.hepsiburada.net/s/35/375-375/10471073349682.jpg" width="200" height="200" </center>
<p>First of all, let me tell you that there is a brand that no one can easily say anything about any feature other than its price. That is Ever Clean. If the price does not exceed your budget, you can buy Ever Clean and pass. Ever Clean has two most preferred types. One is extra clumping (extra clumping) and the other is litterfree paws (does not stick to the paws) I think Litterfree paws is a little better. I left the link here.</p>

    <p>https://www.hepsiburada.com/ara?ftid=pazyoswc14xd92wo&q=ever+clean&siralama=coksatan</p>
</a>

<p>But if you say “Ms. Yağmur, Ms. Yağmur, what is that price?!” then we will look for other sand.</p>

<center><img class="resim" src="https://cdn.dsmcdn.com/ty1551/product/media/images/ty1551/prod/QC/20240917/09/b061154b-5753-3baa-bf78-8d0a176ae67b/1_org_zoom.jpg" width="250" height="250"  </center>

<p>I also used Natural Bastet bentonite litter for a long time. Zero dust is important to me, and I recommend that anyone who adopts a new cat should pay special attention to this issue for both themselves and their cat. It also clumps well and the price is reasonable compared to Ever Clean.I left the link here.</p>

<p><h2><p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">4-CAT FOOD </p></h2> </p>

<center><img class="resim" src="https://st3.depositphotos.com/14786474/17427/i/450/depositphotos_174274356-stock-photo-the-cat-eats-dry-food.jpg" width="200" height="200"  </center>

<p>When it comes to cat food, unfortunately, I can't give you a single brand and close the subject, but I will give you a few brand names. If you have never taken care of a cat before, you can start with one of these brands, then examine the others, consult your veterinarian, and choose the best one for your cat. My advice to you is to never go cheap on this issue. Cheap food means an unhealthy cat. And for an unhealthy cat, the costs of the veterinary clinic will surely exceed the profit you make from the food.
Let's take a look at the brands that will be recommended to you when you adopt a new cat and go to the veterinary clinic; Royal Canin, Pro Plan, Hill's, Virbac or ND are the most recommended ones. I prefer ND or Virbac.
Of course, there is also the issue of wet food. Although many veterinarians in Turkey treat wet food as a bogeyman, this is not a reasonable opinion for me. Veterinarian Lisa Pierson has a very good article on this subject. It is not long, read it and then make up your mind about the frequency of wet food use. You can also choose from the brands above, but my favorites are Royal Canin Babycat wet food if the cat is under 2.5 months old, and Schesir or Princess wet food for older cats.
</p>

<a/> 
<P>So shouldn't we buy food and water bowls?I don't see this as a priority need. You can use steel, porcelain or glass bowls that are not narrow from your home. Later on, you can also buy beautiful food bowls according to your heart, but it is better in terms of budget to postpone it to later months because there will be food, sand, vet expenses, etc. at the beginning.</P>  

<p><h2><p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">5-CAT MALT </p></h2> </p>

<p>After 2.5 months of age, it is especially recommended for every cat to use malt because cats are animals that clean themselves by licking themselves and swallow a lot of hair while doing so. We pay attention to the use of cat malt so that the swallowed hair does not clump in the stomach or intestines and is easily excreted in the feces. Here is the link to the cat malt that I also use and like its content. I recommend that you make your choice after consulting your veterinarian.</p>

<p><h2><p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">6-CAT COMB </p></h2> </p>
<P>If you don't want to be drowning in cat hair at home, and you want your cat to swallow less hair while licking, you need to get into the habit of combing your cat. If you can get her used to it, you can also strengthen the bond between the two of you. So, what kind of comb should you use? I have two recommendations. I recommend using one once a week and one every day.</P>

<p><h2>Cat Comb for Weekly Combing</h2></p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://www.kolaymama.com/furminator-6911661-short-hair-kisa-tuylu-kedi-taragi-medium-large-furminator-taraklar-furminator-28306-12-B.jpg" width="200" height="200"  </center>
<p>This comb, which we will use once a week, is a very powerful comb. If you can comb every part of your cat with this comb for 4-5 minutes once a week, you can get rid of the hair that falls around to a great extent. Furminator cat combs are the best in this business. If your cat has long hair, you can get the longhair ones, if your cat has short hair, you can get the shorthair ones. I will only have one warning. When buying these combs, do not buy the small size. Although it works when your cat is a kitten, unfortunately it is not enough when it grows up.</p>
<p>I'll leave the link to the comb here.</p>

<a/>
<p><h2>Cat Comb for Daily Combing</h2></p>
<p>I don't recommend a powerful comb like the Furminator for everyday use. Combs that pick up more superficial hair are more suitable for daily use. Again, you can collect the hair on the shed surface and it feels like a massage to some cats and they love it. I would like to show you an affordable example that you can get efficiency for daily use;</p>
<center><img class="resim" src="https://productimages.hepsiburada.net/s/400/424-600/110000425501586.jpg/format:webp" height="200" width="200" </center>
<p>I'll leave the link to the comb here.</p>
<a href="https://www.hepsiburada.com/ata-home-kedi-kopek-otomatik-temizlenen-tuslu-tuy-toplayici-tarak-evcil-pet-hayvan-tuy-kil-toplama-fircasi-p-HBCV00003UYXW7?magaza=ATA%20HOME" target="_blank">

<a/>
<p>Many different brands of combs with wires like the one above are suitable for daily use. The protective balls at the end of the wires of some of them can fall off over time, and then the wires can scratch the cat's skin. If this happens, I recommend that you do not continue to use that comb. I have not yet encountered such a problem with the comb in this link, I use it daily.
</p>
<p><h2><p style="font-weight: bold;color: magenta;">7-CAT SCRATCHING BOARD </p></h2> </p>
<p>Cat scratching posts are also a very important need for cats. 
Even if you start to meet this need by buying one, I recommend you to increase it over time. Scratching and climbing is very important for them. 
If they have such areas in more than one part of the house, they will adopt the house more easily and their self-confidence will increase.</p>
<p>Scratching behavior is also an act of determining a space for cats.
In addition, if they do not have enough scratching areas according to their own tastes, they can make places such as armchairs and curtains in the house as scratching areas. </p>
<p> This is why this issue is important. I recommend having different types of scratchers in more than one place in the house, even if it's just one at first. My minimum recommended scratching board for cats is Pugalo. It is 90 cm long and has a large pipe diameter. It also has catnip, which makes it more interesting for cats.
I have this scratcher and it's really good, I think I can use it for many years.</p>

<p><h1>CONCLUSION</h1></p>
<p>Well, won't we get a food bowl? Won't our cat have a bed? NO TOYS, HEARTLESS, I can hear you saying.</p>
<p>“I can't buy a toy for my child?!”&#128512</p> 
<p>I wanted to shape this article a bit around the basic, essential needs. You can buy other things later. If you crumple a piece of paper and throw it away, it's already a toy for the cat. Of course, there are also very nice interactive toys that will keep the cat busy and happy, but you can buy these later. If you have just adopted a cat, I didn't want to add them here because there are already a lot of expenses. </p>
<p>Now, let's do the math, shall we? How much money will you spend on AVERAGE for these 7 items that you will buy right away when you adopt a cat?  Now it's time to do the math!</p>
<p><center><img class="resim" src="https://st2.depositphotos.com/3223173/5286/i/450/depositphotos_52869947-stock-photo-dollar-and-a-cat.jpg" width="200" height="200"  </center></p>

<p>If a new cat owner makes ideal choices that they can use for many years, we see that it costs about 5500₺ at the BEGINNING. Not including the vet clinic costs, but I would like to remind you that most of the purchases are permanent and not recurring. Don't be intimidated by the number.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the end of my article, thank you for reading this far.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself and your cat for now,</p>
<p>Stay with the cat!&#128570</p>
